## Abstract class
a super class gives a genralized form or blueprint not body for the child class these class are known as abstract class.

when the parent class have not body, its totally depends on child to provide a body for that function.

abstract classes are declared but not implement.

any class that contain one or more abstract class,the class must be declared as abstract

if you declare parent class a abstract you must have to override the child methods

you can not create a object of abstract class.
you can not create abstract constructor.
you cant not crate final abstract class.
you can not create abstract static method,because abstract method must be overridden and static can not be override thats why you can not create abstract static method.

you can create static method in abstract class.
you can create normal method in abstract class.

### why
1. it looks cleaner.
2. if you definetly know the methods in parent class needs to overridden make them abstract
