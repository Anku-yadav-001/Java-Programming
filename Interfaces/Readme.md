## Interfaces
interface is a referance type.
interfaces contain abstract classes.
variables are final and static in interface.

### interface vs abstract class
interface is implemented using `implement` keyword and abstract class implemented using `extends` keyword.

you can create multiple interfaces together but you can only extends only one abstract class.

multiple interface is allow in interface, but in abstract class multiple inheritance is not allow.
